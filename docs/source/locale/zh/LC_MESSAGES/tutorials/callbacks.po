"NeMo uses callbacks to do a variety of helper functions during training. "
"NeMo comes with three useful callbacks: SimpleLossLoggerCallback, "
"CheckpointCallback, and EvaluatorCallback. Callbacks are defined prior to"
" calling the train() function, and are passed to the train() function. "
"For example, a common training script will look like:"

"SimpleLossLoggerCallback is used to log training metrics such as loss and"
" time per step to screen and to tensorboard. SimpleLossLoggerCallback has"
" one required arguments, and two arguments that we recommend to "
"overwrite. It requires tensors which is a list of NMTensors that "
"print_func(), get_tb_values(), and log_to_tb_func will receive as input "
"during training. The two reccomended arguments to override are "
"print_func(), and either get_tb_values() or log_to_tb_func()."

#: ../../tutorials/callbacks.rst:30

"print_func() should be used to log values to screen. We recommend using "
"logging.info() in place of print(). For example, it can be used to print "
"the loss value:"

"We provide two methods to log to tensorboard: get_tb_values() and "
"log_to_tb_func(). For simple use case of logging scalars, we recommend "
"get_tb_values(). For advanced use cases such as pictures or audio, we "
"recommend log_to_tb_func()."

msgid ""
"get_tb_values() is used to return values to be logged to tensorboard. It "
"should return a list of 2-element tuples, where the first element is a "
"string representing the tensorboard tag, and the second element is the "
"scalar value to log. Note we currently only support scalar values. Note "
"to use get_tb_values(), tb_writer should also be defined."

"log_to_tb_func() takes three arguments: the `tensorboardX.SummaryWriter "
"<https://tensorboardx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tensorboard.html>`_ , a "

"the SummaryWriter class to add images, audio, and more. For example:"

#: ../../tutorials/callbacks.rst:118
msgid ""
"EvaluatorCallback is used during evaluation to log evaluation metrics to "
"screen and tensorboard. EvaluatorCallback requires three arguments: "
"eval_tensors, user_iter_callback, user_epochs_done_callback. Similar to "
"SimpleLossLoggerCallback, eval_tensors is a list of NMTensors whose "
"values we want to obtain during evaluation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/callbacks.rst:124
msgid ""
"user_iter_callback is a function that is called after each batch during "
"evaluation. It is always passed two arguments: values_dict, and "
"global_var_dict. values_dict is a dictionary containing NMTensor names as"
" keys, and the evaluated tensor as values for that batch. It's main job "
"is to copy the relevant evaluated tensors from values_dict to "
"global_var_dict as global_var_dict is saved between batches and passed to"
" the final user_epochs_done_callback function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/callbacks.rst:131

"user_epochs_done_callback is a function that accepts global_var_dict. "
"It's job is to log relevant information to the screen such as the "
"evaluation loss."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/callbacks.rst:134
msgid ""
"For simple logging of scalar values to tensorboard, "
"user_epochs_done_callback should return a dictionary with strings as keys"
" and scalar tensors as values. This tag -> value dictionary will be "
"parsed and each element will be logged to tensorboard if a tensorboard "
"writter object is declared."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/callbacks.rst:139

"To enable more complex tensorboard logging such as images or audio, "
"EvaluatorCallback must be passed tb_writer_func at initialization. This "
"function must accept a `tensorboardX.SummaryWriter "
"<https://tensorboardx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tensorboard.html>`_ , "
"whatever is returned from user_epochs_done_callback, and the current "
"step. We recommend for user_epochs_done_callback to simply return the "
"global_var_dict for tb_writer_func to consume. The user must log all data"
" of interest inside tb_writer_func including scalars that would otherwise"
" be logged if tb_writer_func was not passed to EvaluatorCallback."
