"QuartzNet is a version of Jasper :cite:`asr-models-li2019jasper` model "
"with separable convolutions and larger filters. It can achieve "
"performance similar to Jasper but with an order of magnitude less "
"parameters. Similarly to Jasper, QuartzNet family of models are denoted "
"as QuartzNet_[BxR] where B is the number of blocks, and R - the number of"
" convolutional sub-blocks within a block. Each sub-block contains a 1-D "
"*separable* convolution, batch normalization, ReLU, and dropout:"
