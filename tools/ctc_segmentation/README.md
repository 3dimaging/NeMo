ASR dataset creation tool
-------------------------

Features:
- preprocess text and audio data
- run CTC-Segmentation
- cut the original audio into segments and create manifest to train/finetune an ASR model

# Requirements:
- ctc-segmentation
- NeMo ASR

Please make sure that requirements are installed.

abstract="Recent end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems demonstrated the ability to outperform conventional hybrid DNN/HMM ASR. Aside from architectural improvements in those systems, those models grew in terms of depth, parameters and model capacity. However, these models also require more training data to achieve comparable performance.",
